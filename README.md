### How to `cook` with someone... kinda

- Let's make sure we understand what we're `cooking`
- Any allergies `edge cases`
- What ingredients do we need `BFS, graph, backtracking`
- `Pseudocode` the recipe (yeah)
- `Functional` mise en place 😍
- Let's start `cooking`!!
- Bon appétit
- Could we `optimize` with sriracha
- Thank your sous chef for their time and consideration

### `Cooking` is fun.
